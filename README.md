# Solid Adventure Challenges

Welcome to the Solid Adventure Challenge! ðŸš€
Charge+ Technical Interview Assessment. 


# About This Quest
This repository contains a series of coding challenges designed to test your skills, creativity, and problem-solving abilities. 
Each challenge is a unique adventure, crafted to push your limits and showcase your talents.



# Submission Guidelines
 - Read the prompt or assessment and prepare a submission that satisfies its requirements.
 - Include all source code, configuration, tests, assets, and documentation, into an archive. (zip, 7z, gztar, etc.)
 - Email your submission to us at "developers@chargeplus.sg"




# Level of Effort Guidelines

 - Each prompt or assessment is designed to take less than 2 hours to prepare a submission.
 - We embrace open source technologies and frameworks. feel free to use any tested framework or libary to saves time and improves quality.
 - Don't make the submission harder than it needs to be. Functionality, Readability, Runnability, and Tests/Analysis are the elements involved in score. Adding scope, creating an entire application, and otherwise gold-plating the solution are unnecessary.
 - Assume any text or strings mentioned may contain unicode characters.
 - Use of any online/AI tool such as ChatGPT, Gemini, etc. are allowed. However, we expect you to fully understand the code and logic involved.



# Evaluation Criteria
Your adventures will be evaluated based on:

 - Correctness of solutions: Does your solution produce the correct output for all test cases?
 - Code quality and organization: Is your code readable, maintainable, and well-documented?
 - Efficiency and performance: Is your solution optimized for time and space complexity?
 - Creativity and Problem-Solving Approach: Did you take a creative or innovative approach to solving the problem? How effectively did you break down the problem and devise a solution?
 - Ability to Handle Edge Cases: Does your solution account for unusual or unexpected inputs, and does it gracefully handle edge cases?



# Integrity Guidelines
We develop software collaboratively and survey available examples. We understand and endorse this practice. 
That said, we want to see your individual capabilities. If you derive your submission from another author or receive assistance:

 - Disclose this with appropriate inline comments and documentation.
 - Improve upon the work you derived from or the approach with which a colleague helped.
 - A cautionary note: It is trivial to determine that a submission is copied or plagiarized.
 - If you use the source code or approach of another engineer, disclose it appropriately or you will be disqualified from the position.
